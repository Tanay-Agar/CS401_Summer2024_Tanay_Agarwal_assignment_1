Homework 1

The calculator works when the user runs the java program. It gives the user an option to input two numbers at the beginning. If the user were to enter invalid inputs the program will ask the user again to enter a valid number until the user enters a valid number. Then the user is provided 4 options: 

1 - Addition 
2 - Subtraction
3 - Multiplication
4 - Division.

If the user does not enter any of these 4 numbers the program it will keep on asking the user to input the correct value until the user enters a valid number

After that the program uses one of the four functions for the operations and the code will print out the result. 
If the user tries to have a value divided by zero the program will flag an error and ask the user if they want to perform another calculation.
After the result has been printed the program will give the user the option to do another calculation or exit. 
If the user inputs a invalid choice in the exit step the program will keep on asking the user until they input a valid choice.
